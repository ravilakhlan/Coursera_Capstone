    "Ideally development in a city should take place uniformly across all parts. But the reality is often different and some areas are left behind whereas other areas are developed at faster pace. This creates a sense of inequity among the residents of the city. Mumbai is one of the most developed cities in India and it is often called the financial capital of India. Whereas the large part of Mumbai is filled with skyscrappers, there are still a big part which even lacks the most basic developmental needs. In this case study we will try to find and highlight such differences on an aggregate scale."
